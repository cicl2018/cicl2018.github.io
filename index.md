This is the course page
for the seminar course
_Challenges in Computational Linguistics_
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

The filed of computational linguistics has a well-established
tradition of "challenges" or "shared tasks" where the participants try
to solve a current problem in the field using a common data set and
a well-defined metric of success. Participation in these tasks is fun
and highly educational as it requires the participants to put all
their knowledge into practice, as well as learning and applying new
methods to the task at hand. The comparison of the participating
systems at the end of the shared task is also a valuable learning
experience, both for the participating individuals and the whole
field.

This course takes its title literally. The students taking the course
are required to participate in a shared task in the field, and solve
it as best as they can. The requirement of the course include
developing a system to solve the problem defined by the shared task,
submitting the results and writing a paper describing the system.

## Requirements

The course requires good programming skills, a working knowledge of
machine learning and NLP, and strong (self) motivation. This typically
means a highly motivated Mater's or advanced Bachelor's student
in computational linguistics or related departments (e.g., computer
science, artificial intelligence, cognitive science). If  you are
unsure, please contact the instructor.

## Shared tasks

In principle, any shared task related to computational linguistics is
acceptable. Here are a few pointers:

- [SemEval](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2019/index.php?id=tasks)
  competitions include a wide range of shared tasks.
- [CoNLL](http://www.conll.org/) hosts regular high-profile shared
  tasks.
- [Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/) project
  organizes multi-lingual dependency parsing competitions. Last two
  instances were associated with the CoNLL.
- Similarly, [SIGMORPHON](http://www.sigmorphon.org/) has regular
  shared tasks. Again, last two shared tasks were associated with CoNLL.
- [Germeval](https://projects.fzai.h-da.de/iggsa/) shared tasks
  are another option, particularly if you'd like to work on German.
- [VarDial workshops](http://alt.qcri.org/vardial2018/) host regular
  shared task related to dialects and closely related languages.
- [SMM4H](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h/social-media-mining-for-health-applications-smm4h-workshop-shared-task/)
  is another workshop with regular associated shared tasks.
- [CLPSYCH](http://clpsych.org/) is yet another interesting venue with
  somewhat regular shared tasks..
- IWCS 2019 has  a new
  [shared task](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20220) on semantic parsing.

The above is only a sample. There are more shared tasks you can find
through a search on the Internet. For the purposes of the class, we
prefer a shared task where you finalize your work with a system
description paper. If all else fails, or if you have a strong
preferences, a CL-related [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
competition may also be an option (you will still be required to write
a system description paper).
